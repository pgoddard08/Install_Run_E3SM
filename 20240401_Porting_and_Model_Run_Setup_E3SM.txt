# Attempting to run a simulation with a compset and grid
# One time I did have a successful run; other times, following what I believe was the same procedure, I got SEGFAULT errors or errors during the step when the run was trying to download input data. This is where I am currently at - trying to have a successful run again. Next, I will reach out to someone with E3SM experience and find a compset and grid that should work and go from there. 4/1/2024.
